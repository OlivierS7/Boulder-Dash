# JPU-BlankProject

So, the team members are:
  SIMONNEAU Olivier,
  GERVOT Lloyd,
  LEBRUN Enzo,

Each member of the group is part of the promotion A1 (SN8CX201) of the engineer school of CESI.EXIA.
The tutors of this promotion are NAIT-CHABANE Ahmed, GAUDON Anne-Laure and GALLET Jérémy.
In this project, we elected a project manager who is Olivier, his role is to make sure that the tasks have been done and that we follow the schedule a max in order to complete the project.

For the context:
  The project is about recreating a game from the start. The game is called Boulder Dash, it was made in 1984 by Peter Liepa et Chris Gray.
The principle of the game is to collect a certain amount of diamond to open a door which bring to the next level. The caracter called Rockford has to dig the dirt to make a way to the diamonds while avoiding ennemis and caring about the stones and the diamonds above him.
Then the game has several features that make the game more exciting. We are not invited to reproduce them all. For example, there is a 2-player mode or also the choice of level on a map.
Thus, relying on a java "helloworld" program, a database and various diagrams, we had to respond to multiple expectations.

About the controls:
  To change the map, you can chose on your numeric keypad one of the five different levels : 1-2-3-4-5.
  And of course, the movement of the player with the keys of the keyboard : W-A-S-D.
